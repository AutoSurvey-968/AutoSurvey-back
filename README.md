# AutoSurvey-back

## A reactive Java back-end project for the automatic management of surveys. QC team members can upload past QC data (in CSV format) to the database, generate surveys for associates to take, and view analytics on the collected survey responses. Associates will be able to complete surveys and submit their responses to the database. This project is developed and deployed as a series of microservices:  
* Gateway Service - Spring Cloud Gateway, Pipeline and Jenkins deployment
* User Service - User authentication, Firebase Management, User Database
* Survey Service - Manages and stores survey information
* Submission Service - CSV and JSON (standard) response data management
* IO Service - Email management
* Analytics Service - Aggregate and filtered data analytics
